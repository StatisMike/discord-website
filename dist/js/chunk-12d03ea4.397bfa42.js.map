Familiarize yourself with Discordâ€™s terms of service and follow them at\n    all times. https://discordapp.com/terms https://discordapp.com/guidelines\n    <br /><br />\n    2. Show respect toward all server members We want this to be a fun,\n    pleasant, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender,\n    gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical\n    appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of\n    members in any form. Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are\n    expected to comply immediately.\n    <br /><br />\n\n    3. No direct message without permission Please do not DM anyone in the\n    server without first asking for permission. If they decline and you persist,\n    you will receive a warning. Repeated offenders will be banned at the\n    discretion of the admins.\n    <br /><br />\n    4. No offensive content Offensive content such as discriminatory, violent,\n    and NSFW content of any kind will not be tolerated. This includes, but not\n    limited to: messages, profile pictures, links, media, usernames and\n    nicknames. Given that we are a learning server, heated discussions of any\n    kind and excessive discussions of a personal nature are frowned upon.\n    <br /><br />\n    5. No shitposting outside of ðŸ’©signposting Keep discussions held in other\n    channels for learning. We expect any heated or potentially offensive (see 3)\n    discussions which arise to be ended swiftly or moved to the ðŸ’©shitposting\n    channel.\n    <br /><br />\n    6. No asking for or offering compensation (monetary or not) for an answer\n    Our community wouldn't be growing as big as it is if our resources aren't\n    free for everyone to access. We are not a tutoring service (there are tons\n    of such services online if you need one), nor should there be any strings\n    attached to answers given. Note that for direct messages, it is up to the\n    members involved to report to the admins.\n    <br /><br />\n    7. No server advertisements without moderator approval This includes any\n    unsolicited server invites to other servers in any channel or DM. It might\n    be acceptable if you are posting an invite in response to someone asking,\n    but try to keep it at a minimum and programming/data science related. When\n    in doubt, ask a @moderator directly or via @ModMail before posting. Note\n    that for direct messages, it is up to the members involved to report to the\n    admins. ---------------------------------------- The first offense of these\n    rules will be warned in private. If it happens again within a three month\n    period you will be temporarily muted from the server for 4 days. If it\n    happens a 3rd time within a three month period you will be banned from the\n    server indefinitely. We reserve the right to modify these rules at any given\n    time to better align with the server's goal. If you see anyone breaking\n    these rules, please alert the mod team using @ModMail or ping @moderator or\n    @admin in the channel that the incident occurred. For DM violations, provide\n    the offender's user ID and a screenshot of your conversation in\n    ðŸ¤¬server-concerns or via @ModMail.\n  </p>\n</template>\n<script></script>\n<style scoped>\np {\n  margin: 0 auto;\n  max-width: 550px;\n  padding: 12px;\n  text-align: left;\n}\n</style>\n","import { render } from \"./Rules.vue?vue&type=template&id=2a60fbf4&scoped=true\"\nconst script = {}\n\nimport \"./Rules.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=2a60fbf4&scoped=true&lang=css\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"/Users/ericfletcher/Documents/programming/discord/website/node_modules/vue-loader-v16/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render],['__scopeId',\"data-v-2a60fbf4\"]])\n\nexport default __exports__","export * from \"-!../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--7-oneOf-1-0!../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--7-oneOf-1-1!../../node_modules/vue-loader-v16/dist/stylePostLoader.js!../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--7-oneOf-1-2!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--1-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader-v16/dist/index.js??ref--1-1!./Rules.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=2a60fbf4&scoped=true&lang=css\""],"sourceRoot":""}
