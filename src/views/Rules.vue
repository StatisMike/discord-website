    1. Familiarize yourself with Discordâ€™s terms of service and follow them at
    all times. https://discordapp.com/terms https://discordapp.com/guidelines
    <br /><br />
    2. Show respect toward all server members We want this to be a fun,
    pleasant, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender,
    gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical
    appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of
    members in any form. Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are
    expected to comply immediately.
    <br /><br />

    3. No direct message without permission Please do not DM anyone in the
    server without first asking for permission. If they decline and you persist,
    you will receive a warning. Repeated offenders will be banned at the
    discretion of the admins.
    <br /><br />
    4. No offensive content Offensive content such as discriminatory, violent,
    and NSFW content of any kind will not be tolerated. This includes, but not
    limited to: messages, profile pictures, links, media, usernames and
    nicknames. Given that we are a learning server, heated discussions of any
    kind and excessive discussions of a personal nature are frowned upon.
    <br /><br />
    5. No shitposting outside of ðŸ’©signposting Keep discussions held in other
    channels for learning. We expect any heated or potentially offensive (see 3)
    discussions which arise to be ended swiftly or moved to the ðŸ’©shitposting
    channel.
    <br /><br />
    6. No asking for or offering compensation (monetary or not) for an answer
    Our community wouldn't be growing as big as it is if our resources aren't
    free for everyone to access. We are not a tutoring service (there are tons
    of such services online if you need one), nor should there be any strings
    attached to answers given. Note that for direct messages, it is up to the
    members involved to report to the admins.
    <br /><br />
    7. No server advertisements without moderator approval This includes any
    unsolicited server invites to other servers in any channel or DM. It might
    be acceptable if you are posting an invite in response to someone asking,
    but try to keep it at a minimum and programming/data science related. When
    in doubt, ask a @moderator directly or via @ModMail before posting. Note
    that for direct messages, it is up to the members involved to report to the
    admins. ---------------------------------------- The first offense of these
    rules will be warned in private. If it happens again within a three month
    period you will be temporarily muted from the server for 4 days. If it
    happens a 3rd time within a three month period you will be banned from the
    server indefinitely. We reserve the right to modify these rules at any given
    time to better align with the server's goal. If you see anyone breaking
    these rules, please alert the mod team using @ModMail or ping @moderator or
    @admin in the channel that the incident occurred. For DM violations, provide
    the offender's user ID and a screenshot of your conversation in
    ðŸ¤¬server-concerns or via @ModMail.
